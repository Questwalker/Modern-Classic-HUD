## How to manually install ##
First you need either shimloader or [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/tag/v3.0.1), and VoidMod by Gato

If you're using UE4SS, make sure ` BPModLoaderMod : 1 ` is set to 1 inside ` mods.txt ` located in the mods folder exctracted from UE4SS zip file, or mods will not work

Extract  `ClassicUI.pak ` from the pak folder into ` <Game Directory>\VotV\Content\Paks\LogicMods `
